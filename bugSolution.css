To solve this issue, explicitly define the width of the parent element. For example:
```css
.parent {
  width: 300px;
}

div {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```
This will ensure that the `calc()` function has a reference point for calculating the width of the child element.  If you are working within a responsive design, use viewport units (vw, vh) as a more reliable approach for calculating element width in relation to the viewport dimensions instead of percentages directly within `calc()`.
